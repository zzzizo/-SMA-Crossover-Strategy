Explanation of Key Parts:
Data Fetching: We download daily historical data for SPY (or any chosen asset).
Moving Average Calculation: Short-term (20-day) and long-term (50-day) SMAs are calculated.
Signal Generation: A Buy signal is generated when the short-term MA crosses above the long-term MA, and a Sell signal is generated when the opposite occurs.
Performance Metrics:
Cumulative Return: The total return generated by the strategy over the period.
Maximum Drawdown: The maximum observed loss from a peak to a trough.
Win Rate: Percentage of positive trades.
Visualization: The strategy is visualized with Buy and Sell signals marked.
This code provides a foundational backtest for the SMA crossover strategy, and further analysis could include enhancing the strategy with more metrics or testing over multiple assets.
